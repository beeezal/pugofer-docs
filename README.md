# PUGOFER Documentation and Notes
This is a temporary repository to track the modifications and additions made in alignment with the ideaology of the Pugofer project. Whose current executable language is openly available to the public in the [pugofer/pug repository](https://github.com/pugofer/pug).

The initial contents of the docs directory is directly extracted from the pug repository (on 04-06-2025). The documentation files' origin (other than pu-additions) is credited to [Mark P. Jones](https://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mpj/) who is the creator of Gofer (later on went to create [Hugs](https://www.haskell.org/hugs/)) from which the **PUGOFER** is derived/forked by [Rusi Mody](https://github.com/rusimody)
